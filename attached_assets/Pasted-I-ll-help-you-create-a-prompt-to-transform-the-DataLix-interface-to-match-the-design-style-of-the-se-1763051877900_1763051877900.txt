**Prompt for Redesigning DataLix Chat Interface:**

Transform the DataLix AI chat interface from the current light, modern design to a sophisticated dark theme matching the second reference image. Here are the specific requirements:

**Color Scheme:**
- Background: Deep charcoal/dark gray (#2b2b2b or similar)
- Text: Light gray/off-white for primary content
- Accent color: Warm coral/orange (#ff7b54 or similar) for buttons and highlights
- Secondary text: Medium gray for subtle elements

**Layout & Structure:**
- Center the main content area with a clean, minimalist approach
- Replace the current welcome card layout with a single, focused chat input area
- Remove the separate "Upload Data" and "Example Datasets" card boxes
- Create a streamlined message input area at the center of the screen

**Chat Interface Elements:**
- Message input: Dark gray box with rounded corners, matching the dark theme
- Input placeholder: Light gray text
- Action buttons: Small icon buttons (+, -, refresh) positioned above or beside the input
- Send button: Coral/orange circular button with an up arrow icon
- Model selector: Dropdown showing "Sonnet 4.5" (or current model) in the top-right of the input area

**Typography:**
- Use a serif font for the greeting (similar to the elegant style in image 2)
- Keep body text clean and readable with a sans-serif font
- Maintain good contrast for accessibility

**Interactive Elements:**
- File attachments should be displayed as small thumbnail previews below the input
- Hover states with subtle transitions
- Smooth animations for message sending

**Overall Aesthetic:**
- Sophisticated, minimal, elegant
- Focus on the conversation interface
- Remove unnecessary UI chrome and decorative elements
- Create a more immersive, distraction-free chat experience

Would you like me to create a React component that implements this redesigned interface?
