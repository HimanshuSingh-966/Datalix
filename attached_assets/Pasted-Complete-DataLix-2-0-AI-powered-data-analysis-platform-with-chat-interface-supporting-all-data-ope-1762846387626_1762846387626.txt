Complete DataLix 2.0: AI-powered data analysis platform with chat interface, supporting all data operations, ML analysis, visualizations, batch processing, pipeline builder, dashboard creation, and database connectivity

I'll include the following features:

    Chat-first UI with message feed, markdown rendering, embedded tables/charts, auto-scroll, typing indicators, message actions (copy/regenerate/edit/delete), search/filter messages, and export chat functionality
    Multi-format file upload (CSV with encoding detection, Excel multi-sheet, JSON nested/flat, Parquet) with drag-and-drop, progress bars, batch upload, URL import, Google Sheets integration, and cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
    Comprehensive data quality scoring (0-100 weighted: completeness 40%, consistency 30%, uniqueness 20%, validity 10%) with column-level metrics, automatic issue detection with severity levels, actionable recommendations, quality trend tracking, and PDF/HTML report generation
    Advanced missing value handling: detection with heatmap visualization, imputation methods (mean, median, mode, KNN, forward/backward fill, interpolation, MICE, model-based), drop options, and detailed results tracking
    Multi-method outlier detection and removal (IQR with configurable multiplier, Z-Score, Modified Z-Score, Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Grubbs test, LOF) with removal strategies (remove/cap/replace/flag), box plots, scatter plots, and distribution comparisons
    Duplicate handling: exact/partial/fuzzy detection with similarity threshold, removal strategies (keep first/last/none), duplicate grouping, and detailed results with percentage impact
    Comprehensive data cleaning: text normalization (lowercase/uppercase/title case), whitespace handling, special character removal, pattern extraction (email/phone/URL with regex), date/time parsing with format standardization, currency handling, unit conversion (metric/imperial), and string operations (trim/pad/HTML cleaning)
    Categorical encoding (label encoding, one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, target encoding) with automatic data type detection, encoding result tracking, and new column creation
    Feature engineering: datetime features (year/month/day/weekday/hour extraction), binning (equal-width/equal-frequency/custom), polynomial features, interaction features, lag features for time series, rolling statistics (mean/sum/std), and cumulative calculations
    Statistical analysis suite: descriptive statistics (mean/median/std/quartiles), correlation matrices (Pearson/Spearman/Kendall) with heatmaps, distribution analysis (normality tests, skewness, kurtosis), hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA), and confidence intervals
    Comprehensive visualization library with Plotly: histograms, scatter plots (with trendlines/color grouping), line charts (single/multi-series), bar charts (vertical/horizontal/stacked/grouped), box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, correlation matrices, pie/donut charts, treemaps, sunburst charts, 3D scatter/surface plots, candlestick charts, waterfall charts, funnel charts, and sankey diagrams
    Advanced data filtering: complex conditions (comparison operators, contains, regex, between), multi-column filters with AND/OR logic, date range filtering, null/not null filters, custom query builder UI, and saved filter templates
    ML analysis operations: anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, LOF, One-Class SVM), clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), feature importance (Random Forest, XGBoost, permutation importance), and visualization of results
    Data transformation operations: normalization (Min-Max, Z-Score, Robust Scaler), log/sqrt/box-cox transformations, pivoting/melting, aggregation (groupby with sum/mean/count/custom), merging/joining datasets, sorting, sampling (random/stratified), and column renaming/reordering
    Data export functionality: CSV/Excel/JSON/Parquet export with custom delimiters, compression options, encoding selection, filtered/full dataset export, column selection, and signed download URLs with 1-hour expiry
    AI integration with Gemini API: function calling for 11+ data operations (upload_and_analyze, clean_dataset, impute_missing, detect_outliers, create_visualization, get_statistics, filter_data, encode_categorical, export_data, generate_quality_report, run_ml_analysis), natural language query interpretation, intelligent recommendations, and conversational context maintenance
    User authentication with email/password, JWT tokens, session management, password hashing with passlib, protected routes, and user profile management
    Interactive data preview tables: compact display with row/column counts, data type indicators, null value highlighting (red), expandable/collapsible functionality, sorting by columns, pagination, and column filtering
    Suggested action buttons: context-aware based on data state and detected issues, horizontal pill layout, click to auto-fill prompts, tooltips, and smart recommendations (4-5 visible)
    Professional UI with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI: responsive design, loading states (typing animation, skeleton loaders, spinners), error handling with retry buttons, modern color scheme, and keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline, Ctrl+K to clear)
